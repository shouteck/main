== PROJECT: WorkoutBook

---

== Overview

Are you a professional athlete who is too lazy to manually search through your workout list to find your favourite workout? Are you an amateur who just started working out and doesn’t know where to begin? Or are you just someone who prefers to have all of your workouts in one place and organized in a tidy manner. Then WorkoutBook is the solution for you! WorkoutBook is a desktop address book application used for anyone who does workouts to manage their workouts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the memory feature which enables users to manage future, current and completed workouts*
** [.underline]#What it does#: This allows the WorkoutBook user add new workouts with an state tag of `future` being attached automatically. In order to set a workout to current, he uses the `current` command which changes the state tag to `current`. He can then finish the workout by setting the state tag to `completed` using the `complete` command. However, he can always choose to reactivate the workout by changing its state tag to `current` using the `current` command again. This flexibility enables users to fit the workouts to their changing preferences.
** [.underline]#Justification#: Users can now remember easily the relevance of each workout according to their desired criteria. `future` reminds the user that they are untouched. `current` informs the user that he is focussing
on this specific one. `completed` tells the user that he has finished this workout before. This is advantageous to the user who can now avoid forgetting whether he has already performed the workout or not.
** [.underline]#Highlights#: This feature requires two new commands - current and complete as well as modification to the pre-existing
add and edit commands to avoid affecting the state tag.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Created the seven classes of Type, Difficulty, Duration, Equipment, Instruction, Muscle and Calories for the Workout.
