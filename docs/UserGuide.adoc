== Introduction

WorkoutBook is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing workouts*. More importantly, WorkoutBook is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Quick Start

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all workouts
* **`add`**`add name/commando workout type/strength duration/20m difficulty/advanced equipment/dumbbell, bench muscle/bicep, tricep calories/150 instruction/set 1: bicep curl reps: 4-6 set 2: tricep extension reps: 4-6 tag/heavy` : adds a Workout named `commando` to the WorkoutBook.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd workout shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as `name/commando workout tag/strength` or as `name/commando workout`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/strength`, `tag/strength tag/fast-paced` etc.
