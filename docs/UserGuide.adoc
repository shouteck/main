== Introduction

WorkoutBook is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing workouts*. More importantly, WorkoutBook is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Quick Start

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : Lists all workouts in the WorkoutBook.
* **`add`**`name/commando workout type/strength duration/20m difficulty/advanced equipment/dumbbell, bench muscle/bicep, tricep calories/150 instruction/set 1: bicep curl reps: 4-6 set 2: tricep extension reps: 4-6 tag/heavy` : adds a Workout named `commando workout` to the WorkoutBook.
* **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd workout shown in the current list of workouts.
* *`exit`* : Exits the application.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add name/commando workout`.
* Below is a list of the remaining parameters with examples of their acceptable formats:

** *_CALORIES_* are positive integers from 1 to 1000. E.g. `120`, `500`, etc.
** *_DIFFICULTY_* and *_PREFERRED_DIFFICULTY_* should only be either beginner, intermediate or advanced.
** *_DURATION_* should only be in this format: E.g. `20m`, `500m`, etc from 1m to 1000m.
** *_EQUIPMENT_* is a list of equipment separated by commas, and it should not be blank. E.g. `dumbbell,bench,mat` and `dumbbell, bench, mat` are valid.
** *_MUSCLE_* is a list of muscle groups separated by commas, and it should not be blank. E.g. `triceps,biceps,back` and `triceps, biceps, back` are valid.
** *_TYPE_* is a list of workout types separated by commas, and it should not be blank. E.g. `cardio,strength,balance` and `cardio, strength, balance` are valid.
** *_INSTRUCTION_* should only contain alphanumeric characters, punctuation, spaces, and it should not be blank. E.g. `set1: dumbbell curls reps: 4-6`.
** *_USERNAME_* should only contain alphanumeric characters, and it should not be blank. E.g.  `John Doe` and `Jane` are valid.
** *_HEIGHT_* should only be in the form x.xx whereby x is any integer. E.g. `1.72` and `1.88` are valid.
** *_WEIGHT_* should only be in the form xx.x or xxx.x whereby x is any integer. E.g. `88.4` and `102.9` are valid.
** *_GENDER_* should only be either male or female.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as `name/commando workout tag/strength` or as `name/commando workout`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/strength`, `tag/strength tag/fast-paced` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `name/NAME type/TYPE`, `type/TYPE name/NAME` is also acceptable.
* White spaces after a slash are automatically trimmed. For example, `add name/ commando workout` and `add name/commando workout` are the same. However, the latter is more visually pleasing.
* Duplicate parameters after one another will only take the last parameter input. For example, `add name/commando workout name/arnold workout` will only add the workout as arnold workout.
